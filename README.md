# Thoughts
This was a very well rounded assignment I had to deploy, interact and read the smart contracts along with wallet handling and utilizing my frontend skills.

I took this assignment as a challenge to try to stick to the Firebond tech stack and used it as a learning opportunity since I never worked with Thirdweb previously

# Challenges Faced
The main challenge that I faced was mainly due to a problem caused by the Thirdweb documentation error.

In the React docs, it was mentioned that to deploy contracts, we have to utilise `ThirdwebSDKProvider` instead of `ThirdwebProvider`. I followed the documentation but I was not able to access the SDK functions. I was throwing all sorts of error and it wasted an entire day after trying all applying all sorts of fixes

I escalated the issue with the Thirdweb support team on discord and even they were not able to fix it. By chance I bruteforced the `useSDK()` with `ThirdwebProvider` and I was sucessfully able to deploy it. The thirdweb team was also surprised and now they are fixing this issue now regarding `ThirdwebSDKProvider` not working

### I would have completed this assignment a day earlier if it weren't for that error ðŸ¤¯

# Areas I focused on

- Tech Stack
    - Next.js, Thirdweb, Tailwind
    - I tried to use the exact tech stack used at Firebond because I wanted to use this assignment as a learning opportunity as well once I start working at Firebond

- Core Functionality
    - I implemeted all the core functionality I was asked to
    - /create
        - Deploy custom ERC20 tokens âœ…
        - Set aside 100 tokens to be claimed âœ…
        - Each wallet cannot claim more than 5 tokens âœ…
    - /claim/[token_address]:
        - Claim token button âœ…
        - fetch token info âœ…
        - display balance âœ…
        - show how many tokens have been claimed âœ…

- Code Quality
    - Used auto-formatting for clean code
    - stored the API key into a seperate .env file to avoid accidental exposure
    - Added well explained comments wherever required

- UI
    - Used tailwind to create and attractive and responsive UI out of the box
